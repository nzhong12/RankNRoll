10/05/2024: Got data from json file. Json is created from SQL server query and remain static.
            No web service or database connection is needed for now.



Todo:
1. Create sidebar for search and filter - done. For now keep it inside App.js - refactor later.
2. Implement Search - todo next 
3. useLoaderData must be used within a data router - todo next.
4. Save user preference to database (MongoDB)?
